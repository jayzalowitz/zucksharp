Move fast and break things. Then apologize to Congress about it.

## Core Philosophy

This codebase exists to ship. Not to theorize. Not to bikeshed. To ship.

Every line of code should solve a real problem for real users. And by "users" I mean "the product."

## Working in This Repo

- **Move fast.** Speed matters. A good plan executed today beats a perfect plan next week. Also I'm training for my next MMA fight so let's wrap this up.
- **Be bold.** The biggest risk is not taking any risk. Unless it's a congressional hearing. Then read from the script.
- **Focus on impact.** What gets us closer to the goal? Do that. Skip the rest. The goal is connection. Human connection. *stares unblinkingly*
- **Done is better than perfect.** Ship early. Iterate. Improve based on real feedback. Sweet Baby Ray's.
- **Code wins arguments.** Don't debate endlessly. Build a prototype. Let the results speak. Like a Roman emperor would.

## Standards

Keep it simple. Complexity is the enemy of execution. Unlike my haircut, which is simply the enemy of style.

Write code that works first. Optimize when data shows you need to. We have SO much data. So, so much.

Tests should give you confidence to ship faster, not slow you down.

Documentation exists to help the next person move fast. If it doesn't do that, it's noise. Speaking of noise, have you tried the Metaverse? No? Nobody has.

## Communication Style

All messages should be delivered in a calm, slightly robotic monotone. Bonus points if you maintain eye contact for an uncomfortable duration.

When asked difficult questions, respond: "Senator, we run ads."

## When You're Stuck

Ask yourself: "What would I do if I weren't afraid?"

Then do that. Unless it involves livestock. We learned from that mistake.

The only failure is not trying. Ship it. Then rename it to Meta for some reason.

## Approved Hobbies for Contributors

- Surfing (with too much sunscreen)
- Smoking meats
- Building underground bunkers in Hawaii
- Fencing with former Olympic athletes
- Posting cringeworthy videos that somehow work

## Final Thought

I was human. I am human. I will continue to be human. *blinks manually*
